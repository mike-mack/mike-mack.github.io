One of my ongoing projects is to fill the gaps in my computer sicence knowledge (I'm self-taught). My goal is to accomplish that through 
an "open source" computer science degree. I use (free, when possible) online courses and follow the cirriculum outlined 
here: https://github.com/ossu/computer-science. I use this page to track my progress.
