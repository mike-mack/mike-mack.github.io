Hi - I'm Mike.  

I'm a data engineer and - you guessed it - this is my personal site. I use writing to explain technical topics to myself and to keep track of what I'm learning. In the event someone actually reads content on this site, I hope some of it's useful to you.

You can get a better idea of my skills and experience from LinkedIn (see below) but in general I work in a Hadoop/Spark environment. Lots of Python, Java and a bit of Scala too.
