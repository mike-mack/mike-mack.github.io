###### What Is LangGraph?
The first challenge I encountered in learning this library was discerning its purpose. Why LangChain and LangGraph (and LangSmith for that matter...)?

My initial understanding is that LangChain is for linear pipelines, and LangGraph is for dynamic workflows. Dynamic meaning workflows that can potentially have branches, loops, decision points, and sub-tasks.

This tool should allow me to create more powerful automations using LLMs and their associated tooling. After following the basic tutorial in the LangGraph documentation, my next problem was deciding what problem to solve with this tool.
